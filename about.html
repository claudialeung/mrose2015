		<div class=about>
			<p>	
	Michael ZT Rose (b.1990) is a multidisciplinary visual artist and composer based in Brooklyn, NY. Michael’s visual and music practices are closely tied and mutually informative. Both simultaneously explore a number of creative processes including automatism, instruction based art and phase art. His work draws formal inspiration from natural phenomenon, cultural realities and personal experience, as well as historic and contemporary ideas such as Baroque, Minimalism and Pluralism. Recent fascinations include the spontaneous counterpoint between the flashing lights and droning siren of a passing ambulance, as well as the complex partnership between abstract concept, participant and consumer of American Football.

	Michael graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design with a BFA in painting in 2013. He was selected to attend the European Honors Program in Rome (2012) where he explored methods of integrating sound and visual art. 
		<br>
		<br>
	At RISD Show MMXII (Palazzetto Cenci, Rome, 2012) Michael debuted two compositions as part of his sound installation: Double Reflection. Michael has also contributed paintings to a number of shows including: Salonuka (Trestle Gallery, Brooklyn, NY, 2014), Wi-fi Art (Circolo Degli Artisti, Rome, 2012) and Demolition Show (New House, Somerville, Massachusetts, 2013) which he also curated.
